# My Coding Learning Journey and Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub pages repository! This repository will not only document my journey in learning coding (my focus is still to be found!) but also serves as my online portfolio and CV.

## About This Repository

This repository contains HTML files (to start) I've created while learning and experimenting with web development. Over time, these files will have evolved into a showcase of my skills, featuring projects and layouts that highlight my growth as a developer.

The main webpage will be designed as my CV and portfolio, to showcase my professional experience, skills, and projects. You can access the very bare beginning here: [My CV Website](https://danitellini.github.io).

## Featured Projects

Below are some of the key projects you can find in this repository:

- **Personal CV Website**
  A responsive HTML webpage designed as my online resume and portfolio. **_TO BE COMPLETED_**
- **_TO BE DETERMINED_**

## How to Use

Once my home page as been completed, you will be able to view all the projects and experiments live via my [GitHub Pages site](https://danitellini.github.io). You'll be able to navigate through the different sections to explore my skills and the projects I've built.

## Goals

- Create an accessible and professional online CV.
- Demonstrate my web development skills (with a plan to incorporate others), focusing on HTML, with plans to integrate CSS and Javascript.
- Build a portfolio to showcase my progress and projects for future job opportunities.

## Feedback and Contributions

I'm open to feedback! If you have suggestions or see something I can improve, feel free to submit an issue or pull request. Contributions are always welcome, and I'm always looking for more ways to further practice.

Thanks for visiting my portfolio and checking my work. I'm excited to continue growing and updating this space with new projects and skills!
